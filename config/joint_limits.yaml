# For beginners, we downscale velocity and acceleration limits.
# You can always specify higher scaling factors (<= 1.0) in your motion requests.  # Increase the values below to 1.0 to always move at maximum speed.

    # we artificially limit this joint to half its actual joint position limit
    # to avoid (MoveIt/OMPL) planning problems, as due to the physical
    # construction of the robot, it's impossible to rotate the 'elbow_joint'
    # over more than approx +- 1 pi (the shoulder lift joint gets in the way).
    #
    # This leads to planning problems as the search space will be divided into
    # two sections, with no connections from one to the other.
